# Checkpoint — autonomous run, 2026-08-14

A working document, rewritten as the run proceeds. It exists so that a context
boundary is not a project boundary: anyone picking this up — including me, in a
fresh context — should be able to continue from the *next task* line without
re-deriving anything.

## Completed this run

| PR | Gap | What |
|---|---|---|
| #133 | G-133, G-134 | Agent step/cost ceilings and handoff depth actually enforced |
| #134 | G-111 | `lapsed` quotation state; ADM-77/78/79 delegated |
| #135 | G-095 | The historical snapshot refuses to run; ADM-58 delegated |
| #136 | G-135 | Consent before sending; **ADM-81 delegated** |
| #137 | G-036 | Upsell opportunities, internal only — trigger taken from §2.7 |
| — | G-034 | Minimum maintenance model — post-handover work, no product invented |

Earlier in the session: G-126, G-130, G-131, G-132, §17 of `check-record`, the
deployment runbook and the external-verification checklist.

## Delegated decisions taken

| Decision | Taken as |
|---|---|
| **ADM-58** | The snapshot refuses to run |
| **ADM-77** | A lapsed quotation may still be **declined** |
| **ADM-78** | `lapsed` is terminal; exits are `→rejected` and `→superseded` only |
| **ADM-79** | Nobody is notified on lapse; no notification machinery |
| **ADM-81** | **No transactional exception** — every client-facing send needs recorded consent |

Each is recorded with its reasoning in `docs/roadmap/roadmap.json`.

## Open gaps (15)

**Delegatable — no external fact needed:**

- **G-012** Follow-up scheduler — *no longer blocked by a decision*; consent model now exists
- **G-013** Portfolio/AI sales assistance — Admin management capability
- **G-037** Client lifetime
- **G-113** Onboarding baseline (ADM-80)
- **G-101** L2 caller — closes only when an L2 agent runs (Phase 5)

**Needs a business decision nobody has taken:**

- **G-136** Consent for a project group is unmodelled *(raised this run)*

**External — cannot be done here:**

- **G-052** deployment (ADM-60 ×5) · **G-091**, **G-122**, **G-123** (Meta)
- **G-110**, **G-116** (external verification) · **G-129** (ADM-85)

## Open decisions (3)

| | |
|---|---|
| **ADM-60** | 5 production facts — external |
| **ADM-80** | Onboarding baseline shape — **delegatable** |
| **ADM-85** | Which provider, whose account — external fact, must not be invented |

---

## External blockers

1. Production Supabase project ref, Vercel plan tier, service-role key custodian, production domain, alert destination
2. A Meta Business account: business verification, App Review → Advanced Access, Tech Provider vs Solution Partner
3. A restore rehearsal — no backup has ever been restored
4. The second AI provider and whose account it sits on

`docs/deployment/external-verification.md` holds the checklist; its sign-off
table is deliberately empty.

## Next task

**G-037 — client lifetime, recorded facts kept apart from derived metrics.**

Do **not** fabricate "lifetime value" as revenue. The repository defines no
monetary meaning for it, and `finance.payments` records what was actually paid
— which is a *fact*. Anything projected from it is a *metric*, and the two must
never be presented as the same kind of thing.

So: the smallest internal representation that reports recorded facts (payments
received, projects delivered, relationship span) and marks anything computed as
computed. No retention probabilities, no forecast, no invented behaviour.

After that, in order: **ADM-80/G-113** (Admin-configurable onboarding
baseline), then **G-012**'s follow-up scheduler — which the consent model in
#136 unblocked.
