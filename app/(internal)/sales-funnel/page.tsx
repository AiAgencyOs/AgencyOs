/**
 * Where the leads are lost — Document 09 §37, and the Sales Dashboard of §30.
 *
 * Every number is a count of rows somebody or something wrote; the definitions
 * live in `crm.sales_funnel` so this page cannot disagree with them. What it
 * adds is the only thing a reader actually wants: the drop between each pair,
 * and which drop is the largest.
 *
 * It refuses to name a leak from too few leads, and says so on the page rather
 * than quietly. With four leads the biggest drop is noise, and pointing at a
 * stage on that evidence is a fabricated insight.
 *
 * Gated on `lead.read`: this is the sales team's own number.
